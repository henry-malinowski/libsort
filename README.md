# libsort
A collection of type agnostic sorting algorithms.

The ultimate goal of this project is to make a collocation of comaritive 
and non-comparative sorting algorithms in a type agnostic fashion.

Some of the comparative algorithms would be...
* Bubble Sort
* Shell Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Sorting networks of sizes 2-to-8.

Some of the non-comparative algorithms would be...
* Count sort
* Radix Sort (LSD)
* Radix Sort (MSD)
